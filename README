# Little Physics Simulation

The term "Game" as you can see as one folder in the repository named Game might
be misleading, it is not a game. It is just a little physics simulation,
specifically parabolic movement simulation (at least for now). I have to admit
that it is not the most optimized code I should've written. I'm dumb and I'm not
able to learn things while also thinking how should the OpenGL renderer or C++
code best to be implemented. So if anyone see this, just want let you to know
that if you think the architecture or implementation is crap, then that is the
reason.

One may ask why not use Markdown so that "I can see the demo". I don't like it.
I think I'm cursed with perfectionism and I can't handle it. I just can't see
README.md but not LICENSE.md and yes I hate LICENSE.md. I prefer pure LICENSE
without any extension. Anyway, talking about license, this is licensed under MIT
License so there's not much restriction.
